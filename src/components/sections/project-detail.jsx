The Problem: As of February 2025, Indonesia faces 7.28 million unemployed individuals, with fresh graduates struggling not just to find jobs, but to prepare adequately for the competitive job market. Existing platforms focus solely on job listings without addressing career readiness.

Our Solution: UrJobs integrates job search with career preparation services including one-on-one mentoring, skill development courses, and industry certifications—creating a holistic ecosystem that bridges the gap between job seekers and employers.

Judges specifically praised our partnership strategy with universities and youth organizations, noting it would enable rapid initial user acquisition.`,

The Problem: Gen Z in Indonesia faces "decision fatigue" — standing in front of full closets feeling like they have "nothing to wear." 88% of Gen Z consider fashion important, yet 64.4% spend less than Rp 500k per shopping trip while constantly feeling stuck in style ruts.

Our Innovation: StyleMe introduced a hybrid model combining AI efficiency (for daily outfit suggestions from digital wardrobe) with human nuance (professional stylists for important occasions). This differentiation addressed the gap we found: pure AI apps sometimes give "horrendous" recommendations, while human stylists are too expensive for daily use.

Market Opportunity: Indonesia's fashion e-commerce market is Rp 232 trillion, with 87.5-88% cart abandonment rate indicating massive decision uncertainty that StyleMe directly addresses.`,

Our Solution: SaveUp makes financial tracking effortless through AI-powered receipt scanning, chatbot-based expense logging, and visual cash flow tracking. It addresses the core issue: Gen Z know they should track expenses, but find manual entry too tedious to maintain consistently.

The Problem: Indonesia is the second-largest food waste contributor globally, with 80% coming from households—totaling 23-48 million tons annually, equivalent to Rp 551 trillion in economic loss (4-5% of GDP). At the household level, unmonitored refrigerators lead to nearly half of food being wasted due to forgetfulness, while meal planning burden (3-4 hours/day) triggers overbuying. Conventional digital solutions remain manual and fragmented, perpetuating the waste cycle.

Our Solution: Takara uses Computer Vision AI for instant stock recognition, adaptive zero-waste recipe algorithms, and proactive expiration reminders. This transforms potential waste into real savings—up to Rp 2 million per household monthly and 30% waste reduction. Through automatic visual scanning, Takara eliminates manual inventory tracking, providing smart recipe recommendations and automatic weekly menu planning prioritizing soon-to-expire ingredients.
